# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio
This is a repository of select machine learning and data analysis projects completed for academic purposes, as examples of my data science work. Each of the below projects are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

More projects are in progress and will be added here when complete.

Tools used:
 - **Python**: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
 - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, keras

## Machine Learning Projects
- [Comparing Classification Models](https://github.com/EliseRattigan/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/classification_model.ipynb): Using Scikit-Learn to train and compare a Support Vector Classifier and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier.
- [Comparing Regression Models](https://github.com/EliseRattigan/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/regression_analysis.ipynb): Using Scikit-Learn to train and compare a Decision Tree Regressor and a Support Vector Regressor.
- [Decision Tree Classifier](https://github.com/EliseRattigan/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/decision_tree.ipynb): Using Scikit-Learn to train a Decision Tree Classifier on an E. coli dataset and predict the class of E. coli.
- [Ensemble Learning with Random Forest Regression](https://github.com/EliseRattigan/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/random_forest.ipynb): Using Scikit-Learn to train and compare two Random Forest Regressors, one with all dataset features included, and another following feature selection.
- [Ensemble Learning with AdaBoost Regression](https://github.com/EliseRattigan/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/adaboost_regressor.ipynb): Using Scikit-Learn to train an AdaBoost Regressor on a dataset of types of abalone, and predict the number of rings on the abalone shell.
- [Deep Learning on Image Data](https://github.com/EliseRattigan/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/Deep%20Learning%20project/deep_learning.ipynb): Using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow to train and compare a Multi-Layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network on image data in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
